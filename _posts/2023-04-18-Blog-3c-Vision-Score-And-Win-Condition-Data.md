Welcome back! In my [previous blog post](https://staticcasttype.github.io/my386blog/2023/03/31/Blog-3b-Vision-Score-And-Win-Condition-Data-Copy.html) I explored the vision score data I collected from Riot Games API. Today I am here to explain the conclusions and present my final data in a clean way.

# Gameplay Background

If you are unfamiliar with League of Legends (if you have followed my blog so far, you should be well aware of the game), vision score is important because it gives your team an edge to know where the enemy team might be, and if you can secure objectives that will give your team a buff. When I was first coming into this dataset, I was expecting a boring data process to fulfill my class assignment, since of course, vision always helps your team win, right?

Maybe not.

## Role Responsibility

Typically, it is the support's job to maintain vision throughout the map.

If you would like to explore this data yourself, you can see the dataset I collected from scraping Riot's API as well as my own EDA and manipulation of the data [here](https://github.com/staticcasttype/blog3).
