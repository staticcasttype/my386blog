# Introduction

Welcome back! In my [previous blog post](https://staticcasttype.github.io/my386blog/2023/03/31/Blog-3b-Vision-Score-And-Win-Condition-Data-Copy.html) I explored the vision score data I collected from Riot Games API. Today I am here to explain the conclusions and present my final data in a clean way.
