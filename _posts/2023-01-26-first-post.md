## My First 386 Blog  

I haven't thought too seriously about which book to read or what to write for my first actual blog post. I also have no idea where to get data from, I just expected that we would cover that at some point later in the class.

Images really capture the eye. Here's a picture of one of my favorite memes. It's a screenshot from a video of John Cena speaking in Mandarin about how he likes ice cream. The meme popularized under the name "Bing Chilling," an English jokesy take on the pinyin "bīng qí lín," meaning "ice cream."
